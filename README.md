##  Documentation
Include your travis badge at the top of your `README.md` file
In your `README.md`, describe the exported values of each module you have defined. Every function description should include it's airty (expected number of parameters), the expected data for each parameter (data-type and limitations), and it's behavior (for both valid and invalid use). Feel free to add any additional information in your `README.md` that you would like.

push() test returns the new altered list and the length of that list

pop() removes the last element in the list and returns the length

filter() returns a new list that have passed requirements

reduce() runs a function against an accumulator to return a single value

forEach() executes a provided function over each element in the list

map() creates a new array with the results of calling a provided function on every element in the list
